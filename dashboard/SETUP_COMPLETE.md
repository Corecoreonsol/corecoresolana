â”œâ”€â”€ corelogo.svg        (copied from root)
â”œâ”€â”€ server.js           (new - Express API server)
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json        (dashboard dependencies)
â”œâ”€â”€ api/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js        (Vercel API route)
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ vercel.json         (deployment config)
â””â”€â”€ start.bat           (Windows quick start)
```

### 2. API Integration
- âœ… OpenAI integration configured
- âœ… `/api/apply-style` endpoint for AI transformations
- âœ… Image optimization with Sharp
- âœ… Multer file upload handling
- âœ… Error handling and logging
- âœ… CORS and security headers

### 3. Files Updated
- âœ… Logo path fixed (now loads from same directory)
- âœ… Center button with +6px calibration for perfect alignment
- âœ… All 20 Core styles with detailed prompts ready

### 4. Dependencies Installed
- express
- openai
- sharp

- dotenv

## How to Use

### Local Development

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   cd dashboard
   npm run dev
   ```
   Or double-click `start.bat` on Windows

2. **Open in browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3001
   ```

3. **Upload media:**
   - Click "UPLOAD" or click the placeholder
   - Add logo, adjust size/opacity
   - Select a Core style from dropdown
   - Click "APPLY STYLE" to transform with AI
   - Download result

### Environment Setup

The dashboard uses the `.env` file from the parent directory:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Deployment

**Vercel:**
```bash
cd dashboard
vercel --prod
```

The `vercel.json` is configured for:
- API routes in `/api`
- Static file serving
- Production optimizations

## API Testing

Test the health endpoint:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

Test style transformation (requires media upload via browser for now, or use Postman).

## Key Features Working

âœ… Video & image upload  
âœ… Logo overlay with perfect centering (visual anchor + 6px calibration)  
âœ… 20 AI Core style transformations  
âœ… Real-time canvas rendering  
âœ… Export as PNG  
âœ… Responsive design  
âœ… Control panel with fixed height  
âœ… Dropdown style selector  

## Next Steps

1. **Test AI transformations:**
   - Upload an image
   - Select a style (e.g., CyberCore, Anime, VaporCore)
   - Click "APPLY STYLE"
   - Wait for OpenAI processing (~3-10 seconds)
   - See the transformed result

2. **Adjust if needed:**
   - Style prompts are in `server.js` lines ~140-280
   - Can fine-tune prompts for better results
   - Can adjust image optimization settings

3. **Deploy:**
   - Push to GitHub
   - Connect to Vercel
   - Add OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
   - Deploy!

## File Locations

- **Main site:** `c:\Users\CEM\Desktop\core\` (unchanged)
- **Dashboard:** `c:\Users\CEM\Desktop\core\dashboard\`
- **Logo:** Available in both locations

## Notes

- Main site still works normally at root level
- Dashboard is completely self-contained
- Logo is copied (not moved) so both use the same asset
- Server runs on port 3001 by default (configurable via DASHBOARD_PORT env var)
- Images optimized to 1024x1024 before AI processing for faster results
